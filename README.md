# Metamorphic
HTML templating languages can be lovely, but it's often a pain to transfer plain HTML into a simple language like that of [Jade](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade). Metamorphic converts HTML into these templating languages, leaving little work for you to do.

Convert your HTML documents to Jade templating syntax with a simple `./bin/metamorphic jade http://example.com/your/html/page.html`.
